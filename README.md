# IBM-Data-Scienece-Capstone-Space #
  # Introduction #
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
# Business Problem #
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch.
# Objectives #
* Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.

* Use data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.

* Write and execute SQL queries to select and sort data

* Use data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.

* Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. 

* Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

* Use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. 

# Deliverables #
* Accurate predictive algorithms

* Business case report to stakeholders
